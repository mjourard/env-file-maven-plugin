## Velocity treats double hashes as comments, which messes with markdown files. So $H can be used instead.
#set( $H = '#' )

Usage
-----

First, define the name and location of your `.env` file within your maven properties. The directory is evaluated from the directory in which this plugin is defined within a pom.xml file.
Define as such:

    <properties>
        <envFileDirectory>../env-files</envFileDirectory>
        <envFileName>.env</envFileName>
    </properties>

This plugin is only supposed to be used for setting environment variables during the test phase.
For this reason, set the execution context to be during one of the phases executed as part of the `test` life cycle but before the execution. 
In this case, we'll go with the `generate-test-resources` phase, but it can be any of the phases executed beforehand.

Add the plugin to your pom:

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
                <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
                <version>${project.version}</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>generate-test-resources</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>loadenv</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

And then the plugin will execute when you call:

	mvn test
